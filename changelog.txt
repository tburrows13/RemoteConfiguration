---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.0
Date: 27 January 2023
  Features:
    - Attempting to build in map view replaces the item in cursor with a ghost so that you don't have to hold 'Shift'
      - When building after exiting map view, the ghost cursor is replaced with a real item again
      - If using Cursor Enhancements, disable "Automatic ghost cursor" in mod settings
    - Press 'R' (or 'Shift + R' for reverse) at any distance to create a rotation request for the selected machine
      - Due to game engine limatations, this does not work on every entity type
      - Since assembling machines specifically can be freely rotated by placing blueprints over them, they now get instantly rotated instead
    - Right-click on a machine at any distance to mark it for deconstruction
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed GUIs opening remotely even though a ghost cursor is in hand
